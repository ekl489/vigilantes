Constructing this portrait took a heavy toll on Siena’s mental health. This recurring struggle to develop a reconstruction of the Slasher, averaging many disparate portraits and creating a shadowy, half-human image left a deep imprint in her troubled mind as in her sleep-deprived and hyper-stressed state the unfinished image of the Slasher was the one consistent feature.\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n        As the investigation progressed Siena and Jonah began to realise their commanding officer, Superintendent Wade was working to hinder their efforts on behalf of the government and wealthy developers.

Appalled, Siena convinced Jonah to strike out on their own. As rogue agents, they adopted call signs to maintain anonymity across their radio channels.

Though Mrs Weingarten suffered from mild dementia, Siena and Jonah were able to learn of the family’s history and pinpointed her son Michael as a prime suspect, a family photo also linking him to Siena’s drawing. Siena realised from Mrs Weingarten’s stories that each of the Slasher’s murders had taken place at a location significant to the boy.

Aggravated, the Slasher, having carved half a smiley face into Siena’s skin, stabbed the knife into her shoulder for safekeeping and went to deal with Riley. Mitchell, grabbing the blade with her teeth, dropped it into her hand and managed to release herself, rushing upstairs in a desperate bid to escape.

Both severely injured they clawed their way through the building, reaching the rooftop. Here they again grappled, bloody and weak. Fuelled by the memories of his victims and how he had damaged her, Siena decided Weingarten had to die and, holding him close, rolled off the edge of the building, just as a dreary Jonah arrived.

the influence and support of major corporations and foreign bodies NSW Premier Mike Baird was able to implement laws prohibiting environmental protests.<br>\n        This opened a path to unprecedented environmental destruction and severe corruption, along with a more authoritative government.<br>\n        Corporations were able to increase their influence and they bought out many groups to further their causes, as did many politicians. With society so corrupt, crime became more prominent as politicians funded crime groups to further their policies.<br><br>\n\n        This surge in the power of the upper class, led to the mass development of Sydney’s urban center and in a push for urban consolidation much of Sydney’s urban sprawl was demolished, forcing those people into the inner city and freeing up land for industrial construction.<br>\n        These people forced into the city contributed to a much higher poverty rate and worsened crime. At first, Sydney’s police struggled to cope under the growing pressure but they were aided by new technologies and increased militarisation.<br><br>\n\n        Then, when Donald Trump won the American election he took advantage of Australia’s newfound instability and close relationship to the USA. Most significantly he pressured the Australian government to discriminate against the Asian population.\n        Trump also sent US troops to Australia to enforce his will and establish further US power there, largely due to the tension in the South China Sea.\n        <br>\n        As a result, many of Sydney’s Asians left the country, fearing for their welfare and lots more moved to Chinatown, which became a refuge for many Asians.<br><br>\n\n        Now Sydney is a city consumed by it’s own greed, where extreme wealth lies right alongside extreme poverty. Crime and disorder are common as oppression and misfortune plagues many of the city’s residents, overwhelmed by their sudden fall from grace. Corrupt, selfish and indecisive, few politicians or leaders have risen to the challenge and Sydney spirals further down into anarchy.<br><br>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data () {\n            return {\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {\n\n        },\n\n        components: {\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n    .tabs ul{\n        margin-left: 0;\n\n    }\n    .tabs {\n        margin-top: 0;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/pages/history.vue","<template>\n    <div id=\"timeline\" class=\"content\">\n        <div class=\"notification is-primary\" id=\"timeline-details\">\n            <h6 class=\"subtitle\">Hover over or select an event to see extra details about it!</h6>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <div id=\"timeline\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data () {\n            return {\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {\n\n        },\n\n        components: {\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/pages/timeline.vue","<template>\n    <div id=\"storylines\" class=\"content\">\n        Storylines coming soon!\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data () {\n            return {\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {\n\n        },\n\n        components: {\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n    .tabs ul{\n        margin-left: 0;\n\n    }\n    .tabs {\n        margin-top: 0;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/pages/storylines.vue","<template>\n    <div id=\"viper\" class=\"content\">\n        hello?\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        data () {\n            return {\n\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {\n\n        },\n\n        components: {\n\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n    .tabs ul{\n        margin-left: 0;\n\n    }\n    .tabs {\n        margin-top: 0;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/pages/viper.vue","<template>\n    <div id=\"viper-viper\" class=\"content\">\n        <div class=\"columns\">\n            <div class=\"column is-two-thirds-desktop\">\n\n                <blockquote>\"Every great story seems to start with a snake.\"</blockquote>\n\n                When discrimination against Asians began, Nick, then a promising young lawyer, helped his friends Tongyi Shen and Jonathan Pan seek refuge in Chinatown. Here they happened upon a hidden Chinese syndicate, the Longying. Seeking protection and a means to empower themselves they joined their cause and spent years training there and immersing themselves in the syndicate.<br><br>\n                During this time he lived in an apartment in Chinatown and completed his training as a lawyer, having long had a passion for the profession.\n                However, as he worked in the business corruption became very evident and Nick was appalled.

While initially a precarious position Siena’s good work and aptitude for her job made her a valued member of the North Sydney police force.<br><br>\n            Soon after she joined the force a serial killer began a reign of terror across North Sydney. Leaving a trail of disfigured corpses in his wake the killer continually eluded police and quickly gained infamy as the ‘Sydney Slasher’. Alongside Sergeant Jonah Riley, Siena worked tirelessly to try and bring the killer to justice gradually adding to a composite drawing of the killer based on various victim and witness reports. Constructing this portrait took a heavy toll on Siena’s mental health. This recurring struggle to develop a reconstruction of the Slasher, averaging many disparate portraits and creating a shadowy, half-human image left a deep imprint in her troubled mind as in her sleep-deprived and hyper-stressed state the unfinished image of the Slasher was the one consistent feature.<br>\n            As the investigation progressed Siena and Jonah began to realise their commanding officer, Superintendent Wade was working to hinder their efforts on behalf of the government and wealthy developers. With the killings taking place in the high-income neighbourhoods of harbourside North Sydney, an area highly sought after by the investors who had redeveloped the now science district to the north, the killings provided an unpleasant but beneficial way to lower the value of the neighbourhood, allowing residents to be pushed out and developers to move in. Appalled, Siena convinced Jonah to strike out on their own. As rogue agents, they adopted call signs to maintain anonymity across their radio channels. Jonah dubbed himself Romeo and Siena Echo 59: Echo in reference to her interest in the police’s sonic weapons and 59 as the call code for ‘criminal mischief.’<br><br>\n\n            <!-- Read More -->\n            <div v-if=\"readmore\">\n                    Over this time Siena became increasingly paranoid and emotionally affected by the horrors she was dealing with daily and as she developed closer bonds with people personally affected by the killings she was determined to do whatever it took to stop the killer.<br>\n                    When the sixth victim was killed Siena and Jonah learnt that there had been another murder in that same house many years before. Suspecting a correlation, Siena dug deeper and met with Mrs Weingarten, the wife of the man killed. Though Mrs Weingarten suffered from mild dementia, Siena and Jonah were able to learn of the family’s history and pinpointed her son Michael as a prime suspect, a family photo also linking him to Siena’s drawing. Siena realised from Mrs Weingarten’s stories that each of the Slasher’s murders had taken place at a location significant to the boy. Realising this pattern they figured that the next killing would take place at the next most significant landmark in Michael’s life, the boarding school he had been sent to after killing his father.<br>\n                    The boarding school, now abandoned due to abuse of the children by the staff, was a huge run down complex in the outskirts of North Sydney. Arriving at Jonah’s early the next night, Siena found him passed out drunk. Furious, she left a note and went to confront the Sydney Slasher on her own, where staking out the boarding school, Siena was ambushed and captured by Michael.<br>\n                    Held captive, Siena was forced to endure the Slasher’s torture, as he began to carve a smiley face into her shoulder. Suddenly, Jonah, still hopelessly drunk stumbled into the room and shot at Michael, missing by a yard and collapsing in a heap. Aggravated, the Slasher, having carved half a smiley face into Siena’s skin, stabbed the knife into her shoulder for safekeeping and went to deal with Riley. Mitchell, grabbing the blade with her teeth, dropped it into her hand and managed to release herself, rushing upstairs in a desperate bid to escape. Suddenly she came to the realisation that she had left Jonah behind and accepting responsibility, she decides to overcome her fear and turned back for Michael.<br>\n                    She hears him hunting her through the corridors and spots him through a crack, seeing that he has Jonah’s gun. Clearly at a severe disadvantage, she stalked him before tackling him and grappling for the gun, shooting Michael in the waist in the process, while he managed to bite into her leg. Both severely injured they clawed their way through the building, reaching the rooftop. Here they again grappled, bloody and weak. Fuelled by the memories of his victims and how he had damaged her, Siena decided Weingarten had to die and, holding him close, rolled off the edge of the building, just as a dreary Jonah arrived. As she fell, Mitchell, close to the wall, struck a small balcony, tossing Michael from her grip and catching her fall as the Sydney Slasher plummeted into the depths of the abandoned building.<br><br>\n                    Eventually Siena returned to the police force where she continues to work as a forensic artist while training to be forensic scientist. However still shaken by her experiences with the Sydney Slasher and concerned by the corruption she discovered, Siena continues to use the identity of Echo 59 to fight crime in the streets of Sydney and ensure there is never another Slasher.<br>\n                    Soon after, Sergeant Riley told her about the Silver Spectre and the growing Sydney Guard and recommended Siena join. She quickly did.<br><br>\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"width: 100%; height: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid black; text-align: center\">\n                <span style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n                    <a v-on:click=\"readmore = !readmore\" class=\"icon is-large\" style=\"position: relative; bottom: 2px; background-color: white\" >\n                        <button class=\"button is-small\" v-show=\"!readmore\">Show More</button>\n                        <button class=\"button is-small\" v-show=\"readmore\">Show less</button>\n                    </a>\n                </span>\n            </div>\n\n            <br>\n\n            <h4 class=\"subtitle\">Arsenal</h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    Sonic megaphone\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>A heavily modified riot squad megaphone able to be used as a sonic weapon, producing sound waves capable of  of breaking walls, knocking back enemies or causing nausea, pain and disonrientation.</li>\n                        <li>The level of damage caused by the weapon depends on the pitch, frequency and volume set.</li>\n                        <li>It also serves as a portable operations hub complete with comms, sound controls and a small computer.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>Glock 43</li>\n                <li>Dark purple smoke bombs</li>\n                <li>Echo 59 costume</li>\n            </ul><br>\n\n            <h4 class=\"subtitle\">Capabilities</h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    Forensic art\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Forensic artist work closely with law enforcement officers to identify criminal suspects and victims through facial composite sketches.

Siena struggled to find work any work as an artist so she was relieved when her old friend Jonah Riley managed to find her a position in the NSW Police as a forensic artist.

Leaving a trail of disfigured corpses in his wake the killer continually eluded police and quickly gained infamy as the ‘Sydney Slasher’. Alongside Sergeant Jonah Riley, Siena worked tirelessly to try and bring the killer to justice gradually adding to a composite drawing of the killer based on various victim and witness reports. Constructing this portrait took a heavy toll on Siena’s mental health. This recurring struggle to develop a reconstruction of the Slasher, averaging many disparate portraits and creating a shadowy, half-human image left a deep imprint in her troubled mind as in her sleep-deprived and hyper-stressed state the unfinished image of the Slasher was the one consistent feature.\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n        As the investigation progressed Siena and Jonah began to realise their commanding officer, Superintendent Wade was working to hinder their efforts on behalf of the government and wealthy developers. With the killings taking place in the high-income neighbourhoods of harbourside North Sydney, an area highly sought after by the investors who had redeveloped the now science district to the north, the killings provided an unpleasant but beneficial way to lower the value of the neighbourhood, allowing residents to be pushed out and developers to move in. Appalled, Siena convinced Jonah to strike out on their own. As rogue agents, they adopted call signs to maintain anonymity across their radio channels.

Suspecting a correlation, Siena dug deeper and met with Mrs Weingarten, the wife of the man killed. Though Mrs Weingarten suffered from mild dementia, Siena and Jonah were able to learn of the family’s history and pinpointed her son Michael as a prime suspect, a family photo also linking him to Siena’s drawing. Siena realised from Mrs Weingarten’s stories that each of the Slasher’s murders had taken place at a location significant to the boy. Realising this pattern they figured that the next killing would take place at the next most significant landmark in Michael’s life, the boarding school he had been sent to after killing his father.\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n                The boarding school, now abandoned due to abuse of the children by the staff, was a huge run down complex in the outskirts of North Sydney.

Suddenly, Jonah, still hopelessly drunk stumbled into the room and shot at Michael, missing by a yard and collapsing in a heap. Aggravated, the Slasher, having carved half a smiley face into Siena’s skin, stabbed the knife into her shoulder for safekeeping and went to deal with Riley. Mitchell, grabbing the blade with her teeth, dropped it into her hand and managed to release herself, rushing upstairs in a desperate bid to escape. Suddenly she came to the realisation that she had left Jonah behind and accepting responsibility, she decides to overcome her fear and turned back for Michael.\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n                She hears him hunting her through the corridors and spots him through a crack, seeing that he has Jonah’s gun. Clearly at a severe disadvantage, she stalked him before tackling him and grappling for the gun, shooting Michael in the waist in the process, while he managed to bite into her leg. Both severely injured they clawed their way through the building, reaching the rooftop. Here they again grappled, bloody and weak. Fuelled by the memories of his victims and how he had damaged her, Siena decided Weingarten had to die and, holding him close, rolled off the edge of the building, just as a dreary Jonah arrived.
